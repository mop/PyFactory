PyFactory: Installation
=====================================

Before you can use *PyFactory* you must actually install it. This document
describes how to install *PyFactory*.

Prerequesites
-------------------------------------
*PyFactory* was tested using **Python version 2.6**. But it might happen to 
run on older versions. Please let me know if you have successfully used
PyFactory with older/newer Python versions :). No other external
libraries/modules are required.

Python can be downloaded at `http://python.org <http://python.org>`_. If you're
using a flavor of Linux or Mac OS X, you most probably already have it
installed.

First of all grab the sourcecode via 
``git clone git://github.com/mop/PyFactory.git`` and run 
``python setup.py install`` as root.

After this you will have:

* :mod:`pyfactory` package in your Python installation's :file:`site-packages`
  directory

That's all to install PyFactory, you may now move on to :ref:`getting_started`.
